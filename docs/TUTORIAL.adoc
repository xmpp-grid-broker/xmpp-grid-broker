= Tutorial setup with openfire and nginx
:toc:


== Requirements

This guide assumes you are using linux or mac os with the `openssl` binary installed.

Also, we assume you have installed `openfire` and `nginx`, and they are reachable under following hostnames:

|===
| Application | Hostname

|nginx server |`xgb.localhost.redbackup.org`
|openfire server |`openfire`
|===

== Generate cerficates

This tutorial requires 3 TLS certificates:

* Hostname `openfire`
* Hostname `xgb.localhost.redbackup.org`
* Client certificate with the `xmppAddr` set to `admin@openfire`.

We also use a custom certification authority (CA) to sign these certificates. For that purpose, we use a script which generates the custom CA and all required certificates in this repository.

To generate the certificates run following steps in this repositorys root:

[source, bash]
----
cd stack/certs
rm -r keys # # <1>
./generates.bash
----
<1> This removes all development certificates.


If you would like to customise the certificate and CA configuration, you can do so by editing the files in `conf`. Note that the script generates additional certificates which are not required for this tutorial.

== Setup nginx

The first step is to copy the required certificates `certs/keys/host`, `certs/keys/client` as well as the CA public key from `certs/keys/ca-fullchain.pem` to the folder `/etc/certs` on your nginx server.

Secondly, add following configuration to you nginx setup (usually in `/etc/nginx/`):

[source]
----
upstream openfire {
    server openfire:7443 fail_timeout=0;
}

server {
    listen 443 ssl http2;
    server_name xgb.localhost.redbackup.org;

    ssl_certificate /etc/certs/host/xgb.localhost.redbackup.org/fullchain.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/certs/host/xgb.localhost.redbackup.org/privkey.pem;

    ssl_verify_client on;
    ssl_client_certificate /etc/certs/ca-fullchain.pem;

    access_log /var/log/nginx/${host}.access.log;
    error_log /var/log/nginx/${host}.error.log info;

    keepalive_timeout 6000;

    # support up to ~20MB uploads
    client_max_body_size 20M;

    add_header 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' 'xgb.localhost.redbackup.org' always;
    add_header 'Access-Control-Allow-Methods' 'GET, PUT, POST, DELETE, HEAD, OPTIONS' always;

    # Openfire BOSH
    location /http-bind {
        if ($request_method = 'OPTIONS') {
            add_header 'Content-Type' 'text/plain; charset=utf-8';
            add_header 'Content-Length' 0;
            return 204;
        }
        proxy_set_header Host openfire;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Host openfire;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Server openfire;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;

        proxy_hide_header 'Content-Security-Policy';

        proxy_ssl_certificate_key /etc/certs/client/admin@openfire/privkey.pem;
        proxy_ssl_trusted_certificate /etc/certs/ca-fullchain.pem;
        proxy_ssl_verify on;
        proxy_ssl_session_reuse off;

        proxy_pass https://openfire/http-bind;
        break;
    }
    location / {
      root /var/www/xgb.localhost.redbackup.org/;
      try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html
      break;
    }
}

== TODO: Setup openfire

Go to the openfire administration interface under https://openfire:9091/ and add the configuration as described in the following screenshots.

.Configure BOSH under _Server → Server Settings → HTTP Binding_
image::tutorial-resources/tutorial_openfire_bosh.png[Openfire HTTP Binding]

.Add your Client-TLS CA to _Server → TLS/SSL Certificates → Client Connections → Trust Store_
image::tutorial-resources/tutorial_openfire_tls.png[Openfire TLS Certificates]


.Require client certificate in HTTP binding under _Server -> Server Manager -> System Properties_: `httpbind.client.cert.policy` = `needed`
image::tutorial-resources/tutorial_openfire_certpolicy.png[Openfire HTT Binding Cert Policy]


.Allow Administrator User access to all Topics under `System Administrators` in _Server → PubSub → System Administrators_ (Don't forget to click `update` afterwards).

== Setup XMPP-Grid Broker

Add the https://github.com/xmpp-grid-broker/xmpp-grid-broker/releases[latest XMPP-Grid Broker release] on the nginx server in the web root folder under `/var/www/xgb.localhost.redbackup.org/`.

Create the configuration file `configuration.json` also in the web root folder `/var/www/xgb.localhost.redbackup.org/` with following configuration:

[source, json]
----
{
  "xmpp": {
    "server":     "openfire",
    "transport":  "bosh",
    "boshURL":    "https://xgb.localhost.redbackup.org/http-bind"
  }
}
----
All configuration options are documented in the link:INSTALL.md#Configuration[expert installation guide].


== That's it!

To access the finished XMPP-Grid Broker setup, start all services and add the client certificate to your browser (in our example setup from `certs/keys/client/admin@openfire/admin@openfire.p12`).
