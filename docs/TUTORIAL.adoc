= Tutorial setup with openfire and nginx
:toc:


== Requirements

This guide assumes you are using linux or mac os with the `openssl` binary installed.

Also, we assume you have installed `openfire` and `nginx`, and they are reachable under following hostnames:

|===
| Application | Hostname

|nginx server |`xgb.localhost.redbackup.org`
|openfire server |`openfire`
|===

== Generate cerficates

This tutorial requires 3 TLS certificates:

* Hostname `openfire`
* Hostname `xgb.localhost.redbackup.org`
* Client certificate with the `xmppAddr` set to `admin@openfire`.

We also use a custom certification authority (CA) to sign these certificates. For that purpose, we use a script which generates the custom CA and all required certificates in this repository.

To generate the certificates run following steps in this repositorys root:

[source, bash]
----
cd stack/certs
rm -r keys # # <1>
./generates.bash
----
<1> This removes all development certificates.


If you would like to customise the certificate and CA configuration, you can do so by editing the files in `conf`. Note that the script generates additional certificates which are not required for this tutorial.

== Setup nginx

The first step is to copy the required certificates `certs/keys/host`, `certs/keys/client` as well as the CA public key from `certs/keys/ca-fullchain.pem` to the folder `/etc/certs` on your nginx server.

Secondly, add following configuration to you nginx setup (usually in `/etc/nginx/`):

[source]
----
include::tutorial-resources/nginx.conf[]
----
<1> See link:docs/SECURITY.md[Security Recommendations]

== TODO: Setup openfire

Go to the openfire administration interface under https://openfire:9091/ and add the configuration as described in the following screenshots.

.Configure BOSH under _Server → Server Settings → HTTP Binding_

.Add your Client-TLS CA to _Server → TLS/SSL Certificates → Client Connections → Trust Store_

.Require client certificate in HTTP binding under _Server -> Server Manager -> System Properties_: `httpbind.client.cert.policy` = `needed`

.Allow Administrator User access to all Topics under `System Administrators` in _Server → PubSub → System Administrators_ (Don't forget to click `update` afterwards).

== Setup XMPP-Grid Broker

Add the https://github.com/xmpp-grid-broker/xmpp-grid-broker/releases[latest XMPP-Grid Broker release] on the nginx server in the web root folder under `/var/www/xgb.localhost.redbackup.org/`.

Create the configuration file `configuration.json` also in the web root folder `/var/www/xgb.localhost.redbackup.org/` with following configuration:

[source, json]
----
include::./tutorial-resources/configuration.json[]
----
All configuration options are documented in the link:INSTALL.md#Configuration[expert installation guide].


== That's it!

To access the finished XMPP-Grid Broker setup, start all services and add the client certificate to your browser (in our example setup from `certs/keys/client/admin@openfire/admin@openfire.p12`).
